## Python-Pytest-Using-pytest-selenium
<!-- [![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/saucelabs-sample-test-frameworks/Python-Pytest-Selenium.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/saucelabs-sample-test-frameworks/Python-Pytest-Selenium) -->

This code shows an example of how to write tests using Pytest with the pytest-selenium plugin with Sauce Labs. The pytest-selenium plugin provides fixtures and functionality to start and stop a browser session in a clean, straightforward way, and has good support for both local browsers and cloud services like Sauce Labs.

As well, this sample works the same with Python 3.6 and Python 2.7.

### Environment Setup

1. Global Dependencies
    * [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * Or Install Python with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
    ```
    $ brew install python
    ```
    * Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) for package installation

2. Sauce Credentials
    * In the terminal export your Sauce Labs Credentials as environmental variables:
    ```
    $ export SAUCE_USERNAME=<your Sauce Labs username>
	$ export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<your Sauce Labs access key>
    ```
3. Project
	* The recommended way to run your tests would be in [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). It will isolate the build from other setups you may have running and ensure that the tests run with the specified versions of the modules specified in the requirements.txt file.
	```$ pip install virtualenv```
	* Create a virtual environment in your project folder the environment name is arbitrary.
	```$ virtualenv venv```
	* Activate the environment:
	```$ source venv/bin/activate```
	* Install the required packages:
	```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Running Tests: 

*  Tests in Parallel: To run tests in parallel against a single browser, run one of:
    ```
      make chrome_case
      make firefox_case
      make safari_case
      make android_case
    ```
    and to run all tests in parallel, run
    ```
      make run_all_in_parallel
    ```

### Advice/Troubleshooting

There may be additional latency when using a remote webdriver to run tests on Sauce Labs. Timeouts or Waits may need to be increased.
